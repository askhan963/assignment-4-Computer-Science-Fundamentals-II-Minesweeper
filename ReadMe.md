Description
Minesweeper is a solitaire computer game in which there are bombs hidden in a grid of cells, 
and the objective is to clear out all the non-bomb cells without hitting a bomb. If a bomb is 
clicked, the game is over in failure.
To help the player determine where the bombs are located, the other cells contain a number 
that indicates the number of bombs in the eight adjacent (both orthogonal and diagonal) cells.
The number on a cell is revealed when that cell is clicked. Additionally, when a cell that has no 
adjacent bombs (let's call this a 0-cell) is clicked, it triggers a "region clear" which means that a 
region beginning with the clicked cell and expanding outward will be revealed at once. The 
region will include all 0-cells connected to the clicked cell, and numbered cells connected to 
those 0-cells. Figure 1 shows examples of 3 cleared regions. For each of these regions, one of 
the inner 0-cells was clicked, and the surrounding region was consequently cleared.
